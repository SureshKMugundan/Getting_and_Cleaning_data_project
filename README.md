Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Course Project

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The data used represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:

Download the zip file from this URL - https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip .
Unzip the file.
Move ALL of the following files to the SAME DIRECTORY as the R script: features.txt subject_train.txt subject_test.txt X_train.txt X_test.txt y_train.txt y_test.txt
Once those steps are complete, you can run the R script (run_analysis.R).
The output of the R script is a tidy data set, tidydata.txt.
You can read more about the data and the analysis in the code book.
